Changes:
 - phenotype.py: add structure to class Individual, set fitness
 - experiment.py: don't save final.p, don't show summary, set labels, track evolution history, save fitness trend
 - plots.py: ignore warnings (due to version compatibility)
 - algorithms/base.py: 
      - keep track of generation (in ask, optimise)
      - consider robot structure (in tell)
      - start evaluation of the whole generation (in optimise)
      - set asked individuals' labels (in ask)
      - avoid duplicated evaluations (in optimise)
 - algoritms/evolution.py: add structure mutation
 - algorithms/search.py: add random structure
