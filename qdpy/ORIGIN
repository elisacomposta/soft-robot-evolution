Changes:
 - phenotype.py: add structure to class Individual
 - experiment.py: don't save final.p, don't show summary, set labels
 - plots.py: ignore warnings (due to version compatibility)
 - algorithms/base.py: 
      - keep track of generation (in ask, optimize)
      - consider robot structure (in tell)
      - start evaluation of the whole generation (in optimize)
